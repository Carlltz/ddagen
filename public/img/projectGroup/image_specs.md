# Relevant Image Specifications

ive been using *p_* for images of people and *_g* for group images. this is to make them sort nicely in the folder. 

## kontakt page

The images of the indivudual people on the contact page should be 744x930px or with the aspect ratio 4:5 (for the best effect). Image names can be chosen freely. The upside with small images is that they go brr while loading. I fixed most of the image size managment using the windows photos tool. I compress the profile pictures w/o image compression.

## About us page

The group pictures are width 2000x1333px or with the aspect ratio 3:2. Image names can be chosen freely.
